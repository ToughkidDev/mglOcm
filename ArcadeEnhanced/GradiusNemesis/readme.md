Ver 1.0 - 

1. Stage 5, Bonus Stage, and Offgame Demo music, which only exist in the MSX version, were used as they were from MSX.
2. For compatibility and convenience of loading, Konami Mapper has been modified to SCC Mapper, but SCC is not required.

Please let me know about any problems you find while playing using the 'Issues' bulletin board here.
    	
I ask for your support so that 
            I can continue to work on a few disappointing MSX version of arcade games in the future.

앞으로 몇개의 아쉬운 MSX판 이식작들에 대해서도 추가 작업을 즐겁게 해나갈 수 있도록 응원을 부탁드립니다.
