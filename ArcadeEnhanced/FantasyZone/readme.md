Ver 1.0 - 

1. Replaced the final boss song "Ya-Da-Yo (Round8)" with "Ya-Da-NE (MD)".
2. Due to the limited capacity of the MSX Megarom, the quality of some songs may differ slightly from that of Arcade version. 
    I ask for your understanding.
3. Used Super Fantasy zone(MD) for MSX version Ending credits.


Please let me know about any problems you find while playing using the 'Issues' bulletin board here.
    	
I ask for your support so that 
            I can continue to work on a few disappointing MSX version of arcade games in the future.

앞으로 몇개의 아쉬운 MSX판 이식작들에 대해서도 추가 작업을 즐겁게 해나갈 수 있도록 응원을 부탁드립니다.
